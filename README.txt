     This project is definitely far from completion, so I will lay out some of the thoughts 
and ideas that went into making this project. While this application is essentially a 
movie database interface, I wanted to give it something that would distinguish it from
what has already been done. After going through movie database sites such as IMDB,
Rotten Tomatoes, and Flixster, I thought it would be nice to incorporate a more social
aspect to this application. Making this application more social might have the following
benefits:

	1. Users can recommend movies to each other, something that even the best artificial
		intelligence might not be able to do as accurately as friends can
	2. Users can see what movies their friends have seen, so users can watch the same 
		movies as their friends and talk about them
	3. Users can review movies for only their friends to see, allowing them to hear what
		their friends thought of the movie before seeing it
	4. Users can plan hangouts with their friends (part of recommending movies)

The main thing I wanted to focus on was design, but I would have liked to add in more interactive 
elements, which I will be listing below:

	1. Fixed all of the interactive elements (buttons, drop downs, etc.)
	2. Made the filtering options actually sort through the list of movies
	3. Implemented the recommendations feature so users can recommend movies to each other
	4. Added the calendar aspect to make it easier to plan when to see movies
	5. Created the Friends page to allow users to see what movies their friends have seen/reviewed
	6. Facebook integration: would have helped the log in process, made adding friends easier,
		and helped with planning movie dates.
